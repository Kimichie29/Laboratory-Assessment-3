- JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Interactive elements such as the image slider and form handling.
- Local Storage API – Storing user input in the contact form.

## Contact-Form Section
The Contact Form Section allows visitors to send messages directly through the website. It is designed with user experience in mind, featuring real-time data storage, validation, and a clean UI.

### How It Works:

Users fill in their name, email, and message in the provided input fields.
As they type, their data is automatically saved in local storage, preventing accidental loss.
When they click "Send," a confirmation alert message appears.
After submission, the form resets and clears stored data.

Features of the Contact Form:
1. Auto-Save with Local Storage – Prevents data loss by saving user inputs in the browser until submission.
